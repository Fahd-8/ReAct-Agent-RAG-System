# Using Qdrant Vector Store with Groq LLM for RAG Project

This guide helps you set up a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) project using Groq's open-source LLM and Qdrant as your vector store. This implementation follows the ReAct pattern shown in the diagram.

## Required Packages

First, install the necessary packages:

```bash
pip install langchain langchain-groq langchain-community python-dotenv requests sentence-transformers qdrant-client
```

## Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in your project root with your Groq API key:

```
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```

## Configuration Options

### Groq Model Selection

Groq offers several open-source models. The default implementation uses `llama3-70b-8192`, but you can change this to any supported model:

- `llama3-70b-8192`
- `llama3-8b-8192`
- `mixtral-8x7b-32768`
- `gemma-7b-it`

Example of changing the model:

```python
self.llm = ChatGroq(
    model="mixtral-8x7b-32768",
    temperature=0.7
)
```

### Qdrant Configuration

The implementation uses an in-memory Qdrant instance by default, but for production use, you should use a persistent deployment:

#### Local persistence:
```python
self.qdrant_client = qdrant_client.QdrantClient(path="./qdrant_data")
```

#### Remote Qdrant instance:
```python
self.qdrant_client = qdrant_client.QdrantClient(
    url="https://your-qdrant-instance-url.com", 
    api_key="your_qdrant_api_key"
)
```

## Using the RAG Implementation

Here's how to use the RAG system with Groq and Qdrant:

```python
from rag_project import RAGProject

# Initialize with your Groq API key
rag = RAGProject(groq_api_key="your_groq_api_key")

# Add documents to the vector store
rag.ingest_documents([
    "RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation, a technique that enhances LLM outputs with external knowledge.",
    "Qdrant is a vector similarity search engine that stores and efficiently searches vector embeddings."
])

# Process a query
response = rag.process_query("How does RAG work with vector databases?")
print(response)
```

## ReAct Pattern Implementation

This implementation follows the ReAct pattern shown in the diagram:

1. **User Query**: The user submits a question
2. **LLM (Reason)**: Groq's LLM processes the query to understand what's being asked
3. **Tools**: The system uses retrieval tools to search the Qdrant vector store
4. **Environment**: Returns relevant documents from the vector database
5. **LLM (Generate)**: Groq's LLM creates a response based on the retrieved information

## Customization Tips

### Improving Embedding Quality

For better semantic search results, you can use different embedding models:

```python
self.embedding_model = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(
    model_name="sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2"  # Better but slower
)
```

### Modifying the Reasoning Strategy

You can adjust the prompt template to improve the reasoning process:

```python
template = """
You are an assistant that follows the ReAct pattern to answer questions.

First, REASON about the question:
1. Identify the key concepts in the question
2. Determine what information is needed
3. Consider how to formulate a helpful response

Context from knowledge base:
{context}

Now, GENERATE a comprehensive answer to: {question}
"""
```

## Troubleshooting

- **"No documents have been ingested yet"**: Make sure to call `ingest_documents()` before `process_query()`
- **Groq API errors**: Check your API key and model availability
- **Embedding issues**: Ensure sentence-transformers is properly installed

By following these steps, you'll have a functional RAG system using Groq and Qdrant that implements the ReAct pattern.



When the user sends this request, the FastAPI endpoint (likely /ingest) processes the input:
If texts is provided, the system takes those strings directly.
If url is provided, the system fetches the webpage, extracts the text (using something like BeautifulSoup, as seen in your previous code), and prepares it.
